Nor should they discriminate against people by doing or abstaining from doing something required to be done.\n",
            "Integrity\n",
            "Company executives should exhibit their personal integrity and courage to uphold their convictions by doing things they perceive as right despite pressures favouring the opposite. They should be respectable, impartial, and committed to their principles. They should fight for their beliefs and never compromise their principles for any objective that would turn them into deceivers or immoral persons.\n",
            "Trust worthiness\n",

            "Loyalty\n",
            "Our executives should exhibit their loyalty to the company by dedicating themselves to their respective duties and to its people by providing support and assistance whenever required. They should not use or disclose confidential information for personal advantage. On the contrary, they should maintain the ability to make decisions independently as professionals, avoiding inappropriate conduct and conflict of interest, as well as being faithful to the company and their colleagues. If the executives intend to leave and work somewhere else, they should notify appropriately in advance and treat the company information as important and confidential. They should not exploit their former positions for their own benefit.\n",
            "Fairness\n",
            "All executives should be fair and just towards all people. They should not use their power deliberately, neither should they resort to cheating or inappropriate tactics to obtain or maintain benefits or advantages from misled or distressed people. Fair-minded executives should disclose the agreements set for consideration and treat everyone equally, be open to disagreeable opinions, willing to admit the mistakes they make, and ready to shift positions and beliefs to appropriate and correct ones, if the situation demands.\n",
            "Concern for others\n",
            "Our executives should be considerate, sympathetic, kind, and well intentioned to others.

They should also pursue proper means to achieving business objectives in a way that the business objectives are aligned with the objectives and interests of people.\n",
            "Respect for others\n",
            "Company executives should mutually respect each other's honour, freedom, privacy, legal and human rights, as well as the interests of stakeholders. In making their decisions, executives should be gentle and treat everyone as equal without discrimination by gender, class, or race.\n",
            "Commitment to Excellence\n",
